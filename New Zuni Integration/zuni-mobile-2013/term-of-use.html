    <h3>5. One Account, for You only</h3>
    <p>You may only create and hold one account on our Site.  Yu must be solely responsible for managing your account.  Your account is non-transferable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any other person.  If your right to access our Site is terminated for any reason, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any unredeemed ZuniSM Bucks in your account.

If you commit fraud or falsify information in connection with your use of the Site or in connection with your ZuniSM account, your account will be terminated immediately and we reserve the right to hold you liable for any and all damages that we suffer, to pursue legal action through relevant local and national law enforcement authorities and to notify your Internet Service Provider of any fraudulent activity we associate with you or your use of the </p>
    <h3>6. Terms of Discounts</h3>
    <p>Discounts that you obtain free or purchase through our Site as a ZuniSM account holder are special promotional offers that you receive from participating Merchants through our service.  The Discounts are redeemable for certain goods, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the Discount.  The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the Discount.  The Merchant is the issuer of the Discount and is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs ("Liabilities") it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Discount or not.  You waive and release us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of the ZuniSM website, your ZuniSM account, a Discount or the services/goods provided in connection with a Discount.</p>
    <p>By purchasing or redeeming any Discount you agree to the terms of this Agreement and these Terms of Sale.  By purchasing, viewing a mobile version, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Discount, you agree to these Terms of Sale specifically ("rules") the terms on the Discount itself and any additional, deal-specific terms advertising the Discount at the time of purchase (collectively, the "fine print" regardless of print size or how it is labeled).  These rules apply to all promotional Discounts that we make available, unless a particular Discount's fine print states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law.  In the event of a conflict between these rules and a Discount's fine print, the Discount's fine print will control.</p>
    <p>We are a service provider for the Merchant identified on the Discount, and the Merchant is the sole issuer of the Discount.  Discounts have two separate values: (a) the "amount paid" and (b) the promotional value.  The "promotional value" is the additional value beyond the amount paid.  Together, the amount paid and the promotional value equals the "full offer value" of the Discount.  For example, if you pay $20 for a voucher that gets you $50 of goods or services from a Merchant, the full offer value is $50, the amount paid is $20 (this amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the Discount unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law).</p>
    <p>If a Merchant or venue refuses to honor any Discount, we will refund the amount paid upon request in the original form of payment, or we will credit the ZuniSM account of the purchaser with an equivalent number of what we call "ZuniSM Bucks" that you may use  for future redemptions of gift certificates listed on the Site.  Zuni Bucks do not expire.  Need a refund or have a question?  Contact us here.  Discounts are not redeemable for cash, unless required by law.  Unauthorized or unlawful reproduction, resale, modification or trade of Discounts is prohibited.</p>
